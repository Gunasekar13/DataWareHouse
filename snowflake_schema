Snowflake Schema in Data Warehouse Model❄️⚡:

✳️The snowflake schema is a variant of the star schema.

✳️Here, the centralized fact table is connected to multiple dimensions.
In the snowflake schema, dimensions are present in a normalized form in multiple related tables.

✳️The snowflake structure materialized when the dimensions of a star schema are detailed and highly structured, having several levels of relationship, and the child tables have multiple parent tables.

✳️ The snowflake effect affects only the dimension tables and does not affect the fact tables.

===========================+

🎯Advantages:
✅There are two main advantages of snowflake schema given below:

✅It provides structured data which reduces the problem of data integrity.
✅It uses small disk space because data are highly structured.

===========================+
🎯Disadvantages:
❌Snowflaking reduces space consumed by dimension tables but compared with the entire data warehouse the saving is usually insignificant.

❌Avoid snowflaking or normalization of a dimension table, unless required and appropriate.

❌Do not snowflake hierarchies of one dimension table into separate tables.

❌Hierarchies should belong to the dimension table only and should never be snowflakes.
